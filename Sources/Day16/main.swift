// data = a + 0 + b
// make a checksum for data[0..<disk size]
// each slice of two:
//   00, 11 -> 1
//   10, 01 -> 0
// repeat until end up with *odd* number of checksum bits.
// 

// it seems like we could figure out what the nth bit is in our final data set
// by figuring out which multiple of our original data size + 1 we are in.
//
// If we're the last bit, then we need to calculate the "joiner" value.
// If we're not, then we just figure out if we're in our original data or its
// reversed/negated counterpart. And you can do that just by checking if the
// dividend is even or not.
// 
// I'm not sure how to calculate the joiner, but its easy enough to generate -- you can do it with the same method.
// But you still end up with DiskSize / OriginalInput.count+1 elements in your array.
// 
// There definitely does seem to be a pattern to the data, but I can't find anything that actually repeats.

// From the wikipedia page on Dragon Curves:
// This pattern also gives a method for determining the direction of the nth
// turn in the turn sequence of a Heighway dragon iteration. First, express n
// in the form k2m where k is an odd number. The direction of the nth turn is
// determined by k mod 4 i.e. the remainder left when k is divided by 4. If k
// mod 4 is 1 then the nth turn is R; if k mod 4 is 3 then the nth turn is L.

// There is a simple one line non-recursive method of implementing the above k
// mod 4 method of finding the turn direction in code. Treating turn n as a
// binary number, calculate the following boolean value:

// bool turn = (((n & âˆ’n) << 1) & n) != 0;

// Therefore we can easily calculate the nth bit using the `subscript` function
// below.

// Strangely, this method is actually slower (~ 400 msec) than directly
// generating the data.
